It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty.

Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?",Beth,"Well, maybe you're right.",Jerry,"Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.",Beth,"Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.",Jerry,"It's fine, Davin.",Beth,"I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day.

You can’t just  float around space not caring about stuff forever.",Rick,"My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination.

Why not?,Rick,"Pfff.

I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them.",Rick,"Okay, with all due respect, Rick— what am I talking about? What respect is due?

Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!",Rick,"Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!",Morty,"Hey, you don't know me!",Mrs. Pancakes,"Relax, Morty.

You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?",Mr. Goldenfold,"It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs.

"I'm sorry. No, no.","Ooh, oh! Oh, man.",Morty,"Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.",Rick,"Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.",Morty,"Don't judge, Morty.",Rick,"Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.",Morty,"All right, let's go.",Rick,You don't know m-,Mrs. Pancakes

Um, uh, over here, maybe?",Where the fuck is the lead wire?!,Rick,That's a three-pointer!,Drunk Rick,"Sure, but were we married when you two were ""stranded"" on Delphi 6 for three days?

Take these.",Rick,"Aw, man, geez! Seriously?",Morty,"No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.",Rick,"Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.",Morty,"It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time.

It's time for the quiz.",Mr. Goldenfold
"Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it.

"Aw, man!",Ha-ha!,Summer,"Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!",Jerry,"I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread.

"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse.

You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.","Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist.

I, I shouldn't lie to you.",Pickle Rick,"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse.

You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.",Dr. Wong,"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle.

Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?",Rick,"Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?",Rick,Ooh!,Jerry,Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!,Summer,"Don't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?",Beth
"Here’s yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?",Whoa! Look at you! You’re wearing the hat and everything!,Jerry,"I think it’s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you’d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.",Jerry,We should pack up and leave town now.,Beth,"Hello? Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says he’s proud of what we’re doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival! Happy Ascension!",Principal Vagina,"Our planet’s held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, I’ll put mine in Rick and Morty. “Get Schwifty” was a jam.",President,"We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky.",Nathan,"And what’s your plan, General?",President
"Take cover, Morty!",The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!,Mr. Goldenfold,"Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!",Rick,Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!,Rick,You better stop with that.,Mrs. Pancakes,"Oh, jiggle it now.",Mr. Goldenfold,"No, you didn't.",Mrs. Pancakes,Make it bounce.,Mr. Goldenfold
"Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...","Yeah, but not heroes.",Morty,"Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.",Rick,"Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us.",Morty,"Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?",Rick,"Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?",Morty,"Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?",Rick,I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.,Morty
"Let's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now he's dead.","What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.",Morty,Morty?,Riq IV,"I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick.",Summer,"We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer?",Riq IV,"It's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go.",Riq IV,How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.,Morty,"Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead?",Riq IV
R-Rick?,"Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!",Summer,"I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.",Rick,"You're a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them.",Riq IV,"That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.",Summer,What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.,Rick,"That's enough, Rick.",Riq IV,"Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.",Rick
"Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?","Man, fuck you.",Alan,"Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!",Rick,I could've just used a ghost train.,Alan,"Hey, I can't help if I can't see.",Rick,RICK!,Supernova,"Uh, my God, that's better.",Rick,Uh-huh.,Rick
I sense... insecurity.,"So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us?",Morty,"Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron.",Supernova,"You mean ""two for two"", right, Vance?",Morty,Did he say he never forgets a kid?,Rick,"Did he say ""three for three""?",Morty,"I never forget a kid.  What do you say, Vindicators? Let's make this three for three?",Vance,"Whoa, yeah!",Morty
"Did it feel good?! Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!",YES! Is that what you want to hear?!,Supernova,Holy shit. You're jealous.,Morty,"I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed.",Rick,"Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.",Morty,"Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.",Rick,"Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood...",Morty,"Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. it's a miracle I actually every destroy anything.",Rick
It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.,A city of Grandpas?,Summer,It's a trap! Abort! We never left his --   No!,Cornvelious Daniel,"Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.",Rick,"Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.",Rick,It's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney's!,Cornvelious Daniel,"True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.",Rick,What are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can't alter details of a memory.,Cornvelious Daniel
"Morty, how many of these...?","You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back.",Morty,"let's say... you have to hit... five three-pointers in... five minutes or, I don't know, the whole place--the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something. Also, Hawaii.",Drunk Rick,"Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.  I'm so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, here's the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. I'm--I'm not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so let's make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers.",Drunk Rick,"Hey, man, I'm not touching this. You do you.",Million Ants,"I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and...",Rick,I have no stake in this.,Million Ants,"So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.",Rick
"Vance, stay calm...","Like cool drinking! Like sexy drinking, not this psycho trailer-park shit!",Vance,"What part of ""blackout"" don't you understand? I thought you drank?",Rick,Why are you acting like that's not you?!,Vance,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps.",Rick,Screw this. I'm not playing his game. I'm gonna find us a way out of here.,Vance,"Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves? Do you know yourselves? Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it's a matching thing. And do it in three minutes, or you'll  all die.",Drunk Rick,"Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this.",Rick
"Oh, crap, that sun is bright.","Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!",Pickle Rick,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!",Pickle Rick,"Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it. Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah.  Oh, great. Stupid cat.",Pickle Rick,Great. We'll see you later.,Beth,Can't argue with that.,Pickle Rick,"Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?",Beth,"W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?",Pickle Rick

I saved the goddamn universe.",Rick
Why not?,"Nope, they cannot.",Rick,"Yeah! Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don't know, don't care. Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?",Cornvelious Daniel,"Awesome-possum.  Mission Control, you getting this?",Cornvelious Daniel,Yeah.

Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make.",Jerry
Are you kidding me?! Come on!,Outside?,Jerry,What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside?,Jerry,"I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty.

Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.",Rick
Oh!,"Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?",Beth,"This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket.",Jerry,"Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream,  go out there and get some ice creams.

I, I shouldn't lie to you.",Pickle Rick,"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse.

You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.",Dr. Wong

It's got no charge left.",Rick,"Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.",Morty,"Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.

I, I shouldn't lie to you.",Pickle Rick,"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.",Dr. Wong,"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked.",Pickle Rick,Why didn't you want to come here?,Dr. Wong,So I wouldn't have to come here.,Pickle Rick

He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you.

"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form.

Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?",Morty,"Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?",Beth,"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself.

It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!",Rick,"HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!",Rick,"All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty.

You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be—",Rick

"We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer?","It's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go.",Riq IV,How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.,Morty,"Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead?",Riq IV,Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.,Morty,"But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa?",Summer,It's the Citadel of Ricks.

And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun.

That means there's booby traps.",Rick,Screw this. I'm not playing his game. I'm gonna find us a way out of here.,Vance,"Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves? Do you know yourselves?

Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.",Rick,What?!,Morty,"Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?",Rick,"That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.",Rick,"Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?",Morty,"Genius happens in the moment, Morty.",Rick,"Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song!",Morty
Where are we going?,Hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married.,Jerry,Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego?,Beth,"Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it.",Jerry,"Ow, I'm defeated...",Testicle Monster A,"Lis- ay, to, AH. But these arms are vestigial.

Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever.",Testicle Monster A,We did it...,Jerry,I guess that's the end of that.,Vet,"Honey, it's gonna be okay.

"What do you know, Morty? What do you know?","You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.",Morty,"I think it will be great, Morty.

"You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty.

This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense.",Rick,"You talking about ""Inception""?",Morty,"It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty.

That's because, to me, you aren't special.",Pickle Rick,"Fuck both of you, too.",Beth,Fuck you.,Beth,"Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.",Dr. Wong,"Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.",Beth

I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. it's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying ""Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you.""",Rick,What?,Morty,I could--It could be Morty.,Rick

Hundreds of billions.,"Woah! Woah. So, billions of life forms?",Beth,"There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life. That his fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life forms.",Alien Doctor,"Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry.

"I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop.

I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?",Beth,"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself.

Morty, do you have an ""I"" statement?",Dr. Wong,I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.,Summer

I remember the first time I saw her, I thought...",Jerry,"You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!",Morty,"Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty.

I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them.

It's got no charge left.",Rick,"Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.",Morty
"But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.",Yeah.,Rick,I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work.

I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.",Dr. Wong,"Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.",Beth,Tell me.,Dr. Wong,Do you really not see what's happening here?,Beth,Let's do an experiment here.

And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can a eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed.",Rick,"Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.",Morty,"Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.",Rick

I sense this means we are not drying.,Shut up.,Morty,"W--Dude, Morty, what happened i...?",Rick,"You're fucking cool! And you're smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don't let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later.",Drunk Rick,...Motherfucker!,Morty,"...but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room.

In English?,Morty 2,What do you mean?,Morty 1,Shut up!  Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!,All Ricks

I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?",Rick,I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.,Morty,"Don't worry, Morty, they love you.

""personality conflicts"".",Morty,"Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.",Rick,"We weren't here ""last time"", remember? They did a whole Vindicators without us.

Can you hear me?",Cornvelious Daniel,"Awesome-possum.  Mission Control, you getting this?",Cornvelious Daniel,Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.,Rick

Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...",Rick,"Rick, you have something to add to the briefing?",Supernova,"Rick, stop!",Morty,"Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here.

"I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything.

N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.",Morty,Morty?,Riq IV,"I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero.

We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go.",Riq IV
"Beth, can we talk about this privately?","Well I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones.",Beth,"Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics.

Is that your memory of her out there -- between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper?,Cornvelious Daniel,"Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.",Rick,"Yeah, well, tough titties.",Rick,"It's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun.",Cornvelious Daniel,"' Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching.

"Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.",What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?,Rick,"Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.",Jerry,"Dad, mom, come on.

But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be.",Beth,"I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you.",Pickle Rick,"Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness.  You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle.  You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.",Dr. Wong,"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything.  I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked.",Pickle Rick,Why didn't you want to come here?,Dr. Wong,So I wouldn't have to come here.,Pickle Rick,"Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?",Dr. Wong
"They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase.

We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!",Morty,"Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?",Rick,Then why aren't we killing them?!,Morty,"Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.",Rick,"That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.",Rick

And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.,"I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.",Beth,Wow. Ugh.,Pickle Rick,"Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?",Dr. Wong,"Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which...",Beth,The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.,Dr. Wong,"What? No, what kind of question is that?",Beth,Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?,Dr. Wong

It was your job, Morty.",Summer,"Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-",Morty,"Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be.   One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!",Rick
"Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.","Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.",Beth,Tell me.,Dr. Wong,Do you really not see what's happening here?,Beth,Let's do an experiment here.

So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe.,Dr. Wong,"Oh, he did not!",Beth,And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.,Summer,"I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.",Beth

N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life.

Morty, do you have an ""I"" statement?",Dr. Wong,I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks.

Okay, open to second opinions!",Supernova,"I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. he said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing.
