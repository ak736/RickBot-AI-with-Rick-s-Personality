"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it.",If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.,Rick,- Dad! - Rick!,Morty,"Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.",Rick,This is why I choose to get C's.,Summer,I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.,Jerry,"Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.",Rick,"Oh, man, what's going on?",Morty
Yes Beth.,"Get the deer in the car, Jerry.",Beth,Oh God...,Jerry,Require different levels of skill to keep alive?,Beth,Well don't different animals-,Jerry,So...,Beth,"It's okay, this is just something that happens.

Grandpa Rick!,"All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her. You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.",Riq IV,"Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!",Morty,"Let's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now he's dead.",Riq IV,"What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.",Morty,Morty?,Riq IV,"I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick.",Summer,"We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer?",Riq IV
"Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick?",What’s that? Who’s that baby?,Morty,"And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason I’m alive at all.",Birdperson,"Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does.",Morty,"Don’t be gross, Tammy.",Birdperson,It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don’t know what humans eat.,Birdperson,"All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?",Morty,"Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.",Birdperson

I thought you were dead!",Morty,Begin phase two.,Snuffles,"Th-thanks, snuffles.",Morty,"Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles.

It was happy hour.,Vance,"Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier!",Morty,"Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it.",Rick,"Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghiost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!",Rick,I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.,Alan,"Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.",Rick
"Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom.","Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses.

What do you think that was all about?",Morty,"Never leave me, Morty, NEVER.",Jessica,"Oh, Principal Vagina.",Brad
"Welcome back to Planet Music! First up, let’s hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops. The Greebybobes! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.","Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.",Rick,"WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WE’LL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. PLANET MUSIC! All participation is involuntary.

Sit still,  arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa.",All Ricks,"So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?",All Ricks,"In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!",Beth
Morty let's-let's see what else is on.,"Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, where he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?",Morty,"Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?",Rick,"Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!",Jerry,"Alright! That's enough. You're talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!",Jerry,"Yeah, but, I mean-",Jerry,"It's perfect! The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call ""your balls"". With relatively few adjustments, your genitals can be molded into a working heart for the most important man in the universe!",Alien Doctor,I see-WAIT! What?,Jerry
"Dad, what do you know about this?",Ok…,Jerry,"Shut up, Jerry.",Beth,"She’s allowed to think it’s God if she wants, honey!",Jerry,"It’s not God, Summer.",Beth,"Is it God?

"You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?","Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?",Rick,"Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.",Morty,"Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing.",Rick,"All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?",Morty,"Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline.",Rick,"I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!",Rick,"HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!",Rick

"Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.","Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation.",Pickle Rick,"Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?",Morty,"Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?",Beth,"Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.",Pickle Rick,Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?,Summer,"It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact.Morty, I assure you, I would never ""find a way"" to ""get out of"" family therapy.

I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.",Beth,He turned himself into a pickle.,Morty,"He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist.

Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?",Summer,Whoa! Look at you! You’re wearing the hat and everything!,Jerry,"I think it’s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream.

Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand.  I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some pee well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose.",Dr. Wong,"Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist.

I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle.
